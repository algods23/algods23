## 👨‍💻 About Me

I build web applications and predictive systems that solve real-world problems, with a focus on data, security, and impact on local industries.

- 📊 **Data Analytics & Predictive Modeling** – from exploratory analysis to production-ready models  
- 🤖 **AI-Based Web Applications** – ML-backed features integrated into modern web stacks  
- 🔐 **Network Security & Database Systems** – secure, reliable, and well-structured data layers  
- 🌱 **Smart Agriculture Technology** – tech solutions that support farmers and agribusinesses  

I enjoy taking ideas from prototype to production, combining software engineering best practices with business-oriented thinking.

## 🌱 Featured Project – Efres Seedlings (Seed2Tree Web)

A regression-based web system that supports smart agriculture in Davao City:

- 🌱 Predicts seedling maturity using **Random Forest regression**  
- 📈 Analyzes plant growth and environmental data  
- 🛒 Integrates **e‑commerce** for farmer-to-buyer connections  
- 🧩 Designed to be extensible for future models and IoT integrations  

> If you’d like, I can help you extract this into its own repo with a full case-study style README.
